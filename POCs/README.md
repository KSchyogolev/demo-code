# Proof of Concepts (POCs)

This directory contains experimental implementations and technical hypothesis validations. Each POC is designed to be completed within 2-3 hours and demonstrates specific technical approaches or validates architectural decisions.

> **Note:** These projects focus on concept demonstrations rather than production code, as the implementation details were rapidly prototyped using Claude Sonnet for validation purposes.
